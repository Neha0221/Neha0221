## Introduction
- I'm a fourth-year B.Tech (CSE) student from IIIT Vadodara, looking for a Software Engineering role.
- I enjoy problem-solving and have solved 500+ DSA questions on LeetCode and GFG coding platforms.
- I have a passion for developing mobile applications and have built multiple apps.
- I use the Flutter framework for frontend, Node.js for backend, and MongoDB as the database.
- I also developed a **Graph Traversal Visualizer**, a window-based application that dynamically visualizes and compares graph traversal algorithms.

## Featured Projects

- **[Grocery Application (Frontend)](https://github.com/Neha0221/Grocery_App)**  
  A complete e-commerce grocery app built with the Flutter framework for the frontend, offering a smooth user interface for browsing and purchasing products.

- **[Grocery Application (Backend)](https://github.com/Neha0221/groceryApp_backend)**  
  The backend of the grocery app, built using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. It includes REST APIs for user authentication, product management, and CRUD operations.

- **[Graph Traversal Visualizer](https://github.com/Neha0221/Graph-Traversal)**  
  A window-based application to dynamically visualize and compare 4 graph traversal algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Priority Queue
  - A* pathfinding (Heuristic Algorithm)
  - Engineered to improve maintainability by 40% and reduce debugging time by 25%.
